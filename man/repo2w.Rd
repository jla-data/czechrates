\description{
A function returning data frame of bi-weekly repo rate, as set by ÄŒNB.
}
\details{
The function expects date input, and returns data frame of two columns - date, and relevant repo rate. It does not require maturity argument, as maturity is by definition 2W.

Repo rates are reported as fractions, i.e. not as percentages (1% = .01).

A single result will be reported for all dates higher than December 8th, 1995.
